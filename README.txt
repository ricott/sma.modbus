Monitor the energy production and consumption of your house by connecting directly to your SMA equipment via your home network.
Use your SMA Energy Meter or Home Manager 2 as a smart meter in Homey Energy. Take action when you have a surplus (exporting energy). Report your energy production to PVOutput.org.

Supported devices
- Inverters
- Hybrid/Batteri inverters
- Energy Meter (incl. Home Manager 2)
- Energy Summary

Ambition is to support all inverters manufactured by SMA, including the new Smart Energy hybrid inverters.

Energy Meter
The Energy Meter device type supports both the Energy Meter and the Home Manager 2.0 products. Both products generate the same multicast datagrams required to access the built-in meter information.
This device type will be recognized in Homey as a smart meter and visualized properly on the energy tab.

Energy Summary
The Energy Summary is a virtual device that gathers information from inverter and energy meter devices registered in your Homey. It will only display information from inverters and energy meter devices from this app. It shows four values; PV Power, Grid Power, Battery Power, and Consumption.

PVOutput
Report your inverter(s) status to PVOutput.org.
