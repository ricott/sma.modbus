        <b>This wizard will repair your SMA inverter connection</b>
        <br/><br/>
        The app will attempt to locate your device using the SMA speedwire auto-discovery protocol. If your inverter has moved to a new IP address, this process will help find and reconnect to it.
        <br/>
        If the device is not automatically detected, you can manually enter the new IP address of your inverter.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>
            NOTE! Make sure your inverter is still accessible on the network and that Modbus is enabled on the device.
